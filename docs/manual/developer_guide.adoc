== How to Test oscap Anaconda Addon

Anaconda has capability to load installer updates using _"updates image"_. This image can be loaded from different storages and use different formats. This page should show one working use case, not all possibilities.

What do you need to test your changes?

1. Clone addon repository & use required branch & change code.
2. Build addon update image.
3. Serve image using local HTTP server.
4. Load system with update image.


=== Clone repository & use required branch

The rhel7-branch uses Python 2 and supports RHEL7 Anaconda, whereas the `master` uses Python 3, and supports Fedora.


=== Build image

We will create cpio archive `ASCII cpio archive (SVR4 with no CRC)` packed using gzip (`gzip compressed data`).
On RHEL installation media, the OAA package and its dependencies are included, but this is not the case with Fedora.
Therefore, the archive has to contain those dependencies.

You can use the `create_update_image.sh` script in the oscap-anaconda-addon repository to create the `update.img` image.
If some time has passed since you have created the image, you typically want to re-download fresh RPM dependencies in the process, so the image is up-to-date in all aspects.

For further reading, see the https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Anaconda/Updates#How_to_Create_an_Anaconda_Updates_Image[official docs].

----
./create_update_image.sh download_rpms
----

If you want to see what was packed, you can extract the image.

----
gunzip -c update.img | cpio -id
----

or use the `lsinitrd` command, which is part of the `dracut` package on RHEL and Fedora:

----
lsinitrd update.img
----


=== Serve image using HTTP server

You don't need public HTTP server or setup Apache.
You can use simple python HTTP server - it serves all files in you current directory.

----
python3 -m http.server
----

**Setup your firewall rules correctly to make webserver port accessible from virtual machine.**


=== Load system with update image

If you want to load your changes to anaconda, you have to setup boot options correctly.
You have two ways how to setup it:

- Manually
- With Network Install/PXE boot

If you want to set it manually, you have to boot your machine into grub. Then you can change options (usually using "tab" key).

If you use Network Install/PXE boot you can pass requires parameters there - look for `kernel options`.
Advantage of this solution is that you will not need to change parameters during every boot.

**Required boot parameters:**

----
inst.updates=http://gateway:8000/update.img
----

Here, `gateway` is supposed to refers to your host machine:

* On Fedora, you have to enter the IP address of the virtual bridge interface.
* On RHEL, the `gateway` hostname will be recognized correctly.

Remember that you can also provide your custom-built SSG content to the installer this way -
you may copy your datastream to the directory that is served by the server as it contains the image, and then,
enter `http://gateway:8000/my-custom-ds.xml` as a remote content URL.

Watch the console, as the VM is supposed to download the update image, and the Python server should output the corresponding HTTP request:

`<IP> - - [<date>] "GET /update.img HTTP/1.1" 200 -`

200 is the OK request status.


=== Further introspection of Anaconda

After reaching the Anaconda GUI, you can switch into another VT and check out that the update went OK by examining the files on the disc.
You can also debug Anaconda in a sophisticated way - as of 04/2018, switching to tty1 brought you to a TMUX session with windows attached to various processes.
There is also an official https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_debug_installation_problems[how-to-debug documentation] though.


== Running Unit Tests

Following packages are needed to run unit tests:

----
anaconda
openscap-python3
python3-cpio
python3-mock
python3-pytest
python3-pycurl
----

Run the unit tests using:

----
make unittest
----
